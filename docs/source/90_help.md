# Getting help

## Mailing List

[The avocado mailing list](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/avocado-developers) is a good
way to sync up with other people who use avocado, including the core developers. You can subscribe
by sending an email to `avocado-developers+subscribe@googlegroups.com` or just post using
the [web forum page](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/adam-developers).

## IRC Channel

A lot of the developers are hanging on the [#adamdev channel on freenode](http://webchat.freenode.net/?channels=adamdev).
Come join us and ask questions.
