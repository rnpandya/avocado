# Introduction

avocado is a variant calling engine built on top of the [ADAM](https://www.github.com/bigdatagenomics/adam)
genomics analysis platform. avocado is designed to support a variety of variant calling analyses,
including germline joint variant calling and somatic variant calling. avocado is built on top of
[Apache Spark](http://spark.apache.org/), and is optimized for running distributed across a cluster,
or on a single machine.

AVoCaDo loosely stands for "A Variant Caller, Distributed". To maximize confusion, we always
spell avocado's name as lowercase.
